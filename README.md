<b> Functionality & Concepts used : </b>

- The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the students select their branch, semester, grade points, and also whether the subject is opted by student or not. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :
- Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
- Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience dropdowns and interactive buttons made it easier for students to use the application.
- RecyclerView : To present the list of different subjects we used the efficient recyclerview.
- Firebase: As a backend server to provide the data about subjects in semester we used the Google Firebase realtime database.

<b> Application Link & Future Scope : </b>

The app is currently in the initial development phase with NITD institute with a limited no. of users, You can access the app : [YOUR APP LINK HERE]
